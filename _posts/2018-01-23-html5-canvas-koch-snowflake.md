##### a Koch Snowflake going from 3 to 12,288 sides

3, 12, 48, 192, 768, 3072, 12,288

A [Koch Snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) is a fractal that is generated by the recursive subdivision of line segments. For the Snowflake, the initial state happens to be three line segments that form an equilateral triangle.

At each step, we perform the following operation:

### How to code this?

There are two steps to coding this.

1. The data and display problems: how to store and draw the line segments that we generate?
2. The geometry problem: how to subdivide each segment and generate smaller segments? We need an object that constitutes a segment, and that object should have a method to divide itself into three smaller segments.
