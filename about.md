#### *I help craft software to bring people joy*.
I have 2 years of focused full-stack web development using JavaScript, and nearly two years experience testing enterprise electronic health records software.

* JavaScript (vanilla and otherwise), jQuery, ExpressJS, Node, React, Angular, D3.js, Chart.js, Mocha and Chai
* HTML5, CSS (including SASS & SCSS), Web Audio API
* SQL/Oracle, MongoDB
* Python, Ruby, some C++

As a philosophy major, I pick up new concepts easily and am experienced with taking both broad and micro level views of an issue. I enjoy solving problems and encountering issues before code ships, so that the end user never knew they were there. I also have a passion for usability and good design.

Active on [GitHub](https://github.com/thmsdnnr) (400+ commits/yr), [Front End Developer Certified](https://www.freecodecamp.org/thmsdnnr/front-end-certification), and 99th percentile on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/thmsdnnr).

I am currently open for new projects and offers. [Let's talk](mailto:thmsdnnr@gmail.com)!
